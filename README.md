3. Allow users to sign up/log in
4. Allow logged-in users to CRUD records
5. Web UI
6. K8s deployment
7. Analytics/monitoring
8. Prod setup - real database, monitoring, alarming
9. General RSS reader functions (track read status, show other data from the feed)
10. Track New Comic page should have autocomplete/dropdowns with data entered by other readers to minimize data entry.
11. "Open multiple new tabs" javascript helper
